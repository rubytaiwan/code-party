# Code Party — RubyConf Taiwan × COSCUP 2025 Edition

“So many amazing developers from around the world… but I’m not sure how to start a conversation, so I just quietly listen 🤐”  
“Honestly… I’m more used to communicating through code than chatting at a party 🤖”  
“The talks were fantastic! But I didn’t have time to try things out on the spot or dive deeper with the speakers 🥲”  
“I want to contribute to open source, but I just end up staring at the repository not knowing where to start 🤯”  
“I tried to use the break time between sessions to pair program with someone I admire, but the space and timing just didn’t work out 🤦🏻‍♀️”

🤝 Then come join us at the Code Party!

## “What’s Code Party?”

[Code Party at RubyKaigi](https://andpad.connpass.com/event/347970/) is an event invented by Ruby committer Kouhei Sutou（[@kou](https://github.com/kou)）. The mission is to let people enjoy the fun of writing code together — a meetup where developers connect through the language they know and love the most: **code**.

This year, we’re bringing that spirit to Taiwan. Code Party will create a relaxed and collaborative space, with multiple topic tables hosted by active contributors from the community.

We’re actively inviting a group of speakers including Matz to join the Invited-Theme Tables; we’ll also open up Free-Theme Tables, and you’re welcome to share your interests with us during registration!

The venue will be equipped with grouped tables and chairs, monitors, and power outlets. Just bring your laptop, meet your group, share with new friends about your OSS experiences, and start writing something fun together:

💡 Even experienced developers might find themselves thinking, “Ah, I didn’t know that could do this!” or “So that’s how this works,” or “You’re working on the same issue I am!”

🐣 Even newcomers to OSS will have the chance to observe and take part in real contributor discussions — maybe even offer a fresh perspective!

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 And even if you don’t produce anything that day, that’s totally fine — debugging, experimenting, and laughing together is what this community is all about.

Let’s make this Code Party a memorable little highlight of RubyConf Taiwan × COSCUP 2025!

# Code Party — RubyConf Taiwan × COSCUP 2025 版！

「來了好多世界各地厲害的開發者！但不知道怎麼開啟交流，所以我都默默聽講 🤐」
「其實……比起在酒會聊天，我更習慣用程式碼溝通 🤖」
「演講好精彩！但來不及現場嘗試實作、並和講者深入討論 🥲」
「我想貢獻開源，但面對喜歡的 repo 卻不知道從哪開始 🤯」
「想利用議程空檔，和憧憬的開發者一起寫點什麼，卻發現時間太短、場地不方便 🤦🏻‍♀️」

🤝 來參加 Code Party 吧！

## 「Code Party……是什麼？」
 
每年在 RubyKaigi 舉辦的 Code Party，由 Ruby Committer 須藤 功平 (@kou) 發明，宗旨是：讓大家自在地享受一起寫程式的樂趣；不僅是交流活動，更是一個讓開發者們透過最熟悉、最熱愛的方式相遇的聚會：寫程式！

這次，我們將在臺灣嘗試復刻這樣的精神。Code Party 將營造一個輕鬆且自由的協作空間，由社群中活躍的開發者主持多個主題桌。我們正積極邀請包含 Matz 在內的講者群參與 Invited-Theme Tables，同時也預計開放 Free-Theme Tables，歡迎你在報名時分享感興趣的主題！

現場會配置分組桌椅、螢幕與電源，你只需要帶上筆電，加入小組、與新朋友聊聊彼此的開源社群見聞、動手寫點有趣的程式碼 ——

💡 即使是資深開發者，也能再遇到「啊，原來XXX也能做到這個」、「原來XXX是這樣運作的」或「原來你也想解決XXX的這個問題」這樣的瞬間。

🐣 即使是剛接觸開源的新手，也有機會觀察、參與到真實的開源討論，也許能用新鮮的角度提出新的可能！

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 即使當天沒有寫出什麼成果也沒關係。幾個人一起 debug、試錯、大笑，本身就是這個社群的精神！

讓我們一起把這場 Code Party 變成 RubyConf Taiwan x COSCUP 2025 中，一段值得回憶的小小高光時刻！
